# smoke.sh — regression smoke tests for the jjstack memory system.
#
# Deterministic and (almost entirely) side-effect-free: syntax checks, pure
# library functions, and --dry-run paths. The one test that writes does so to a
# throwaway slug and cleans up. Codifies the behaviors verified by hand during
# the 2026-07 memory rebuild so they don't silently regress.
#
# Usage: test/smoke.sh   (exit 0 = all pass, 1 = a failure)

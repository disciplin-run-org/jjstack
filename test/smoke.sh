# smoke.sh — regression smoke tests for the jjstack memory system.
#
# Deterministic, fast, and HERMETIC: syntax checks, pure library functions, and
# --dry-run paths, all run against a throwaway $HOME and throwaway fixture
# projects. The tests that write do so inside that sandbox and it is removed on
# exit. Codifies the behaviors verified by hand during the 2026-07 memory
# rebuild so they don't silently regress.
#
# HERMETIC IS THE POINT, not a nicety. These tools read and write the
# developer's real memory store, the real gstack learnings, and the real gbrain
# index. An assertion aimed at those is three separate bugs at once: it reads
# state another process (the capture-on-end worker) mutates concurrently, so it
# flakes; it produces a different verdict on every machine, so a failure cannot
# be reproduced; and a guard watching a directory the run never touches passes
# identically whether the code works or not. Section 6 is the guard that keeps
# it that way — read it before adding an assertion here.
#
# Usage: test/smoke.sh   (exit 0 = all pass, 1 = a failure)

# ── The sandbox ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# One throwaway $HOME for the WHOLE file, exported before the first assertion.
# Every tool under test derives its stores from $HOME — the native memory root
# ($HOME/.claude/projects), the gstack learnings root ($HOME/.gstack/projects),
# the slug resolver and the gbrain repo-policy CLI (both under
# $HOME/.claude/skills/gstack/bin) — so redirecting $HOME once makes the whole
# suite hermetic BY CONSTRUCTION rather than one assertion at a time. That
# distinction is the lesson of this file's own history: the fixture was built
# for the write assertion in section 4 and not carried twenty lines up, leaving
# the Layer-B block reading the developer's live store in the very change whose
# purpose was hermeticity. A per-assertion fixture is only ever as wide as the
# assertion that prompted it.

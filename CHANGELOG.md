# Changelog

All notable, user-facing changes to jjstack are recorded here. This is a
high-level summary for people who USE jjstack — what's new or different and
why it matters — not a commit log. For commit-level detail, read the git
history.

The format loosely follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- **Capturing a lesson no longer has to reach the network to tell you what it
  would do.** `jjstack-capture-write --dry-run` was querying the live gbrain
  index before printing its plan — so a preview that changes nothing still
  waited on a remote lookup, and its answer drifted as the index grew. Set
  `JJSTACK_CAPTURE_NO_GBRAIN=1` to pin the semantic dedup layer off for a fast,
  repeatable answer (useful offline or air-gapped); duplicate detection by
  pattern key still runs, so dedup is reduced rather than silently skipped. The
  dry-run output now states which dedup layers ran instead of leaving you to
  guess. The test suite uses this, and went from intermittently failing to
  stable — and from seconds of waiting to under three.

- **A gbrain lookup that failed no longer claims it ran clean.** The dry-run's
  dedup report used to say `ran-clean` — "semantic dedup ran and found no
  duplicate" — whenever the lookup did anything other than time out. A corrupt
  or unreadable index, a gbrain binary that had been moved, or a bad deadline
  value all produce the same empty result as a genuine no-match, so the run
  reported success while doing nothing. Those cases now report
  `ran-error:<code>` and their empty answer is discarded rather than believed.
  `ran-clean` again means only what it says.

- **The gbrain lookup deadline is documented and adjustable.**
  `JJSTACK_CAPTURE_GBRAIN_TIMEOUT=<seconds>` (default 8) sets how long capture
  waits for the semantic dedup query. On a slow link or a large index, raise it
  instead of turning dedup off entirely — previously the only documented remedy
  was `JJSTACK_CAPTURE_NO_GBRAIN=1`, which removes the layer altogether.

### Changed

- **`/review` is now the deepest review in the stack — on purpose.** It used to
  be a light wrapper over gstack's review. It now deliberately trades time and
  tokens for coverage: it runs *every* specialist (gstack normally skips them on
  diffs under 50 lines and auto-retires ones that have been quiet), and it adds
  eight passes the fast reviewers skip — git history, prior review comments,
  code-comment and CLAUDE.md compliance, plus the security, test-coverage,
  concurrency/resource-leak and error-handling sweeps that Anthropic's
  `/code-review` drops by design. Casting that wide normally means noise, so
  every finding must now survive a verification step: quote the line that
  motivates it, name a concrete failure scenario (the input that triggers it and
  the wrong result), and carry a 0–100 confidence score. Anything under 40 is
  dropped, 40–59 lands in an appendix instead of vanishing silently, and the
  main report is ranked by severity. Use it before a merge that matters; use
  gstack's `/review` or the code-review plugin when you want fast and cheap.
- **gstack upgraded 1.58.5.0 → 1.81.0.0** for everyone on jjstack. Highlights:
  browsing skills are far more resilient (setup no longer aborts when the
  bundled browser fails to download), gstack no longer clobbers same-named
  skills you own during an upgrade, `/ship` can no longer hang forever on a
  backgrounded subagent, and the upgrade path itself can no longer delete your
  install on a failed swap.

### Added

- **Reviews now keep the rubric that produced them.** `/review` snapshots
  gstack's durable review docs (the checklist, every specialist definition, the
  Review Army and adversarial procedures) into your repo next to the findings,
  stamped with the gstack version and commit they came from. Previously that
  rubric lived only in the global gstack clone, which upgrades rebuild from
  scratch — so a six-month-old review was uninterpretable, and nothing recorded
  that the standard had shifted underneath it. Now the git diff on those files
  is a visible record of when the review bar changed.
- **`references/code-review-best-practices.md`** — the sourced manual behind
  `/review`: how Anthropic's and gstack's reviewers are actually tuned, twelve
  ranked practices for high-recall/low-noise AI review, the dimension checklist,
  and the anti-patterns that make a reviewer untrustworthy.

- **A real cross-session memory that recalls, captures, and consolidates
  lessons.** jjstack now remembers what you've taught it and surfaces it when
  it matters. Every prompt quietly recalls the relevant notes — this project's
  own lessons, your pan-project preferences ("how you like things done
  regardless of repo"), and lessons from your other projects — matched by
  meaning, not just keywords. When a session ends, durable lessons are captured
  automatically (no more remembering to run a save command). And `/groom cross`
  finds things you've told several projects and promotes them to one shared
  place, so the same lesson stops living in five copies. Sensitive projects opt
  out and keep their memories local-only. Turn auto-capture off any time with
  `JJSTACK_NO_CAPTURE=1`.
- **The Definition of Done is now a version-controlled reference.** The
  "done-done" checklist that decides when work may be called *done* now
  lives in the repo at `references/definition-of-done.md` as the single
  canonical source, instead of only in a machine-local config file. The
  skills that gate on completion cite it directly, so the rules travel with
  jjstack and stay in sync.
- **Two new done-done rungs.** Calling something "done" now also requires
  updating the change log with an end-user summary (this file) and keeping
  the README reflecting the product's current state — extending the
  checklist from 8 rungs to 10.

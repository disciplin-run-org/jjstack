# Changelog

All notable, user-facing changes to jjstack are recorded here. This is a
high-level summary for people who USE jjstack — what's new or different and
why it matters — not a commit log. For commit-level detail, read the git
history.

The format loosely follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **A real cross-session memory that recalls, captures, and consolidates
  lessons.** jjstack now remembers what you've taught it and surfaces it when
  it matters. Every prompt quietly recalls the relevant notes — this project's
  own lessons, your pan-project preferences ("how you like things done
  regardless of repo"), and lessons from your other projects — matched by
  meaning, not just keywords. When a session ends, durable lessons are captured
  automatically (no more remembering to run a save command). And `/groom cross`
  finds things you've told several projects and promotes them to one shared
  place, so the same lesson stops living in five copies. Sensitive projects opt
  out and keep their memories local-only. Turn auto-capture off any time with
  `JJSTACK_NO_CAPTURE=1`.
- **The Definition of Done is now a version-controlled reference.** The
  "done-done" checklist that decides when work may be called *done* now
  lives in the repo at `references/definition-of-done.md` as the single
  canonical source, instead of only in a machine-local config file. The
  skills that gate on completion cite it directly, so the rules travel with
  jjstack and stay in sync.
- **Two new done-done rungs.** Calling something "done" now also requires
  updating the change log with an end-user summary (this file) and keeping
  the README reflecting the product's current state — extending the
  checklist from 8 rungs to 10.
